-The Program stores produce data and formats it properly so that searches may be made against it
-In it's simplicity the program runs fairly fast and should not take an excess amount of memory.
-The code could be enhanced by an increased understanding of practises used to avert problems of memory leakage that is inherient to C++, 
while the program is simple and does not need much optimization for storage or safety, when used as a example for a larger project, there is much to be desired.
- ordering the database of items or using an unorganzied map instead could increase search time for example. 
- during this class the main piece of information I gained was proper use of pointers an reference objects, which has is turn changed the structure of some of my most used patterns.
- the main ways i kept this program maintainable and readable was focusin on sepperating functions in a way that made logical sense. As for adaptability, making each object open enough 
that it can be modiefied while still used in the main function allows for a multitude of produce to be used.
